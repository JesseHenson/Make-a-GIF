🤹 Make A GIF 🏄‍♂️

It is a web application in Python that uses the Streamlit framework and the MoviePy library to convert video files into animated GIF images. 

It also enables the user to change a variety of GIF conversion-related settings, including the number of frames per second, the duration of the export, the export speed, etc.
